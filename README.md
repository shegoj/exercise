# Simple number to words converter
This work is based soley on something similar I did a while ago. https://github.com/shegoj/python_workshop/blob/master/codes/yoruba-trans.py

## Here are the things implemented
 - Main code implemented in Python using a simple class to abstract details
 - can translate up to 99999999
 - Created a wrapper to manage how the code is used. The wrapper provides a 'console' to manage user interraction
 - Code baked into Docker image

## To Run
- execute  `sh start`
- This tests the Python code and if successful builds the Docker image and starts a container
